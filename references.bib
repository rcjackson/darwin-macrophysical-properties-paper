abstract = {Abstract A new, satellite-based methodology is developed to evaluate convective mass flux and large-scale total mass flux. To derive the convective mass flux, candidate profiles of in-cloud vertical velocity are first constructed with a simple plume model under the constraint of ambient sounding and then narrowed down to the solution that matches satellite-derived cloud top buoyancy. Meanwhile, the large-scale total mass flux is provided separately from satellite soundings by a method developed previously. All satellite snapshots are sorted into a composite time series that delineates the evolution of a vigorous and organized convective system. Principal findings are the following. First, convective mass flux is modulated primarily by convective cloud cover, with the intensity of individual convection being less variable over time. Second, convective mass flux dominates the total mass flux only during the early hours of the convective evolution; as convective system matures, a residual mass flux builds up in the mass flux balance that is reminiscent of stratiform dynamics. The method developed in this study is expected to be of unique utility for future observational diagnosis of tropical convective dynamics and for evaluation of global climate model cumulus parameterizations in a global sense.}

abstract = {Abstract A stochastic prognostic framework for modeling the population dynamics of convective clouds and representing them in climate models is proposed. The framework follows the nonequilibrium statistical mechanical approach to constructing a master equation for representing the evolution of the number of convective cells of a specific size and their associated cloud-base mass flux, given a large-scale forcing. In this framework, referred to as STOchastic framework for Modeling Population dynamics of convective clouds (STOMP), the evolution of convective cell size is predicted from three key characteristics of convective cells: (i) the probability of growth, (ii) the probability of decay, and (iii) the cloud-base mass flux. STOMP models are constructed and evaluated against CPOL radar observations at Darwin and convection permitting model (CPM) simulations. Multiple models are constructed under various assumptions regarding these three key parameters and the realisms of these models are evaluated. It is shown that in a model where convective plumes prefer to aggregate spatially and the cloud-base mass flux is a nonlinear function of convective cell area, the mass flux manifests a recharge-discharge behavior under steady forcing. Such a model also produces observed behavior of convective cell populations and CPM simulated cloud-base mass flux variability under diurnally varying forcing. In addition to its use in developing understanding of convection processes and the controls on convective cell size distributions, this modeling framework is also designed to serve as a nonequilibrium closure formulations for spectral mass flux parameterizations.}

    abstract = { AbstractCumulus parameterizations in weather and climate models frequently apply mass-flux schemes in their description of tropical convection. Mass flux constitutes the product of the fractional area covered by convection in a model grid box and the vertical velocity in cumulus clouds. However, vertical velocities are difficult to observe on GCM scales, making the evaluation of mass-flux schemes difficult. Here, the authors combine high-temporal-resolution observations of in-cloud vertical velocities derived from a pair of wind profilers over two wet seasons at Darwin with physical properties of precipitating clouds [cloud-top heights (CTH), convective–stratiform classification] derived from the Darwin C-band polarimetric radar to provide estimates of cumulus mass flux and its constituents. The length of this dataset allows for investigations of the contributions from different cumulus cloud types—namely, congestus, deep, and overshooting convection—to the overall mass flux and of the influence of large-scale conditions on mass flux. The authors found that mass flux was dominated by updrafts and, in particular, the updraft area fraction, with updraft vertical velocity playing a secondary role. The updraft vertical velocities peaked above 10 km where both the updraft area fractions and air densities were small, resulting in a marginal effect on mass-flux values. Downdraft area fractions are much smaller and velocities are much weaker than those in updrafts. The area fraction responded strongly to changes in midlevel large-scale vertical motion and convective inhibition (CIN). In contrast, changes in the lower-tropospheric relative humidity and convective available potential energy (CAPE) strongly modulate in-cloud vertical velocities but have moderate impacts on area fractions. Although average mass flux is found to increase with increasing CTH, it is the environmental conditions that seem to dictate the magnitude of mass flux produced by convection through a combination of effects on area fraction and velocity. }

abstract = {Abstract Very-high-frequency wind-profiler data are used to study the vertical draught structure within 13 tropical Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) near Darwin, Australia during the 1989-90 and 1990-91 wet seasons. These studies are supported by single-Doppler radar, soundings, and surface rainfall data to correlate radar reflectivity, thermal buoyancy, and surface rainfall patterns with vertical air-motion structures. Because of Darwin's unique location at the southern tip of the Maritime Continent, vertical draughts in both the monsoon (maritime) and monsoon break (continental) convective regimes can be observed. The break-regime MCSs (six in total) were all squall lines, characterized by a leading line of convection with heavy precipitation and trailing stratiform rainfall containing a characteristic radar bright band. These MCSs exhibited a pronounced life-cycle pattern and were all sampled by the profiler in the mature to dissipating stages. In contrast, the monsoon systems (seven in total) were composed of regions of stratiform cloud with embedded convective bands which moved on-shore in the monsoonal flow. Results from the Darwin rain-gauge network indicated that the majority of the total rainfall in each MCS (break and monsoon) was associated with the convective portion of the system. The break-regime MCSs were all characterized by a low-level (4 km) updraught peak associated with convective cells on the leading edge of each squall line, trailed by deeper convective updraughts in the middle and upper troposphere. For the monsoon cases, the lower-troposphere convective updraughts were typically less than those in the squall lines, yet were stronger in the upper troposphere. The low-level differences in the convective updraughts were consistent with the smaller virtual-temperature excess in the monsoon soundings, as well as the larger vertical radar-reflectivity gradients observed in monsoon convection. Consistent with the differences in vertical air-motion patterns, diabatic heating and moistening profiles for the monsoon MCSs were characterized by a higher-level heating and drying peak compared with the break MCSs. The results have important implications for cumulus parametrizations in numerical models since the large-scale circulation is sensitive to the vertical distribution of diabatic heating in tropical MCSs.}

    abstract = { Abstract Wind profiler data wore used to determine the vertical motion structure in four tropical mcsoscale convective systems (MCSs), which occurred during the Down Under Doppler and Electricity Experiment (DUNDEE) near Darwin. Northern Territory, Australia. Three of the MCSs occurred during the monsoon-break convective regime and one occurred during the monsoon regime. In the break regime cases (each with a leading convective and trailing stratiform region structure), the wind profiler sampled low-level convective cells on the leading edge of the convective region, trailed by deeper updrafts of comparable magnitude. Surface rainfall measurements from a network of raingauges showed two comparable peaks in rainfall intensity that roughly corresponded to the passage of low-level and deep convective updraft (71\%–80\% of the system total rainfall was associated with the passage of the convective line). In the stratiform region, the profiler data showed generally weak vertical drafts (<1 m s−1) and the presence of both mesoscale upward and downward motion (17\%–28\% of the system total rainfall was associated with the passage of the stratiform region). Deep subsidence in the transition zone located between the convective and stratiform regions was also documented in each of the break regime cases. Composite vertical motion profiles in different regions of the break MCSs were constructed and the salient features of the profiles are described. The composite vertical motion profiles are compared to similar profiles from different graphical regions. The evolution of the monsoon MCS was different from the break regime cases. This system was characterized by a series of convective updrafts embedded in stratiform cloud. }

Active MJO events with increased rainfall occurred in October, November, and December 2011. During each of these active MJO phases, in addition to enhanced rainfall, convection became deeper and ice-phase microphysics played a greater role. S-PolKa consistently showed nonoriented small ice particles dominating the radar echoes at altitudes of 9–10 km, dry aggregates concentrated between 7 and 9 km, and wet aggregates and graupel near the melting level (~5 km). Graupel occurred mainly in actively convective towers, while the wet aggregates occurred almost exclusively in the stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). During each of the three multiweek MJO active phases, the maximum rainfall occurred in short bursts lasting a few days. Each multiday rainy period began with deepening convective elements and a concurrent increase in occurrence of dry aggregates, which maximized just prior to organization into MCSs. The peak rainfall occurrence coincided with the maximum coverage of the radar domain by MCSs, reflecting large stratiform regions that exhibited the most frequent occurrence of wet aggregates. During the December active MJO phase, however, the MCSs were shallower and had a slightly lower tendency for wet aggregates in the stratiform regions and, therefore, generally weaker brightbands.}

By tracking the evolution of the depth of several thousand individual model simulated precipitation features, the role of and the processes that control the observed midtropospheric moisture buildup ahead of the detection of deep convection are quantified at large and convection scales. The frequency of shallow-to-deep convection transitions is found to be sensitive to this midlevel moisture and large-scale uplift. This uplift along with the decline of large-scale drying by equator-ward advection causes the moisture buildup leading to the initiation of the MJO. Convection scale moisture variability and uplift, and large-scale zonal advection play secondary roles.}

abstract="Convective cloud variability on many times scales can be viewed as having three major components: a suppressed phase of shallow and congestus clouds, a disturbed phase of deep convective clouds, and a mature phase of transition to stratiform upper-level clouds. Cumulus parameterization development has focused primarily on the second phase until recently. Consequently, many parameterizations are not sufficiently sensitive to variations in tropospheric humidity. This shortcoming may affect global climate model simulations of climate sensitivity to external forcings, the continental diurnal cycle of clouds and precipitation, and intraseasonal precipitation variability. The lack of sensitivity can be traced in part to underestimated entrainment of environmental air into rising convective clouds and insufficient evaporation of rain into the environment. As a result, the parameterizations produce deep convection too easily while stabilizing the environment too quickly to allow the effects of convective mesoscale organization to occur. Recent versions of some models have increased their sensitivity to tropospheric humidity and improved some aspects of their variability, but a parameterization of mesoscale organization is still absent from most models. Evidence about the effect of these uncertainties on climate change projections suggests that climate modelers should make improved simulation of high and convective clouds as high a priority as better representations of low clouds.",

    abstract = { Abstract Radar and electrical measurements for deep tropical convection are examined for both “break period” and “monsoonal” regimes in the vicinity of Darwin, Australia. Break period convection consists primarily of deep continental convection, whereas oceanic-based convection dominates during monsoonal periods, associated with the monsoon trough over Darwin. Order-of-magnitude enhancements in lightning flash rates for the “break period” regime are associated with 10–20-dB enhancements in radar reflectivity in the mixed-phase region of the convection compared with the monsoonal regime. The latter differences are attributed to the effect of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and its nonlinear influence on the growth and accumulation of ice particles aloft, which are believed to promote charge separation by differential particle motions. CAPE, in turn, is largely determined by the boundary-layer wet-bulb temperature. Modest differences (1°–3°C) in wet-bulb potential temperature between land and sea may account for the order-of-magnitude contrast in recently observed land–ocean lightning activity. }

The general goal of DUNDEE was to investigate the dynamical and electrical properties of tropical mesoscale convective systems and isolated deep convective storms. Darwin, situated at the southern tip of the “maritime continent,” experiences both monsoon and “break” period conditions during the wet season. We discuss the observational network deployed for DUNDEE and present preliminary scientific results. One particularly interesting observation is a large contrast in the frequency of total lightning between break period convection (high lightning rates) and convection in the monsoon trough (low lightning rates). A relationship between CAPE (convective available potentional energy) and total flash rate is presented and discussed to explain this observation. }

    abstract = { Abstract A cluster analysis is applied to the mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) that developed in northern Australia and the surrounding oceans during six wet seasons (September–April) from 1995/96 to 2000/01. During this period, 13 585 MCSs were identified and tracked using an infrared channel (IR1) on the Japanese Meteorological Agency Geostationary Meteorological Satellite 5 (GMS5). Based on the lifetimes of the MCSs, the area covered by cloud, the expansion rate of the cloud, the minimum cloud-top temperature, and their zonal direction of propagation, the MCSs are grouped objectively into four classes. One of the strengths of the analysis is that it objectively condenses a large dataset into a small number of classes, each with its own physical characteristics. MCSs in class 1 (short) are relatively short lived, with 95\% having lifetimes less than 5 h, and they are found most frequently over the oceans during the early and late parts of the wet season. MCSs in classes 2 and 3 [long and intermediate west (Int-West)] are longer lived and propagate to the west, developing over continental northwest Australia in deep easterly flow during breaks in the monsoon. These two classes are distinguished principally by their lifetime, with 95\% of MCSs in the long class having lifetimes exceeding 4 h. Class 4 (Int-East) comprises MCSs that form over the subtropical latitudes of eastern Australia and in the deep westerly flow over northern parts of the continent during the monsoon and active phases of the MJO. }

Particular attention is focused on the sampling geometry of the PR and the resulting impact on PF statistics across the global Tropics. It was found that 9\% of rain features extend to the edge of the PR swath, with edge features contributing 42\% of total rainfall. However, the area (maximum dimension) distribution of PR features is similar to the wider-swath TMI up until a truncation point of nearly 30 000 km2 (250 km), so a large portion of the feature size spectrum may be examined using the PR as with past ground-based studies. This study finds distinct differences in land and ocean storm morphology characteristics, which lead to important differences in rainfall modes regionally. A larger fraction of rainfall comes from more horizontally and vertically developed PFs over land than ocean due to the lack of shallow precipitation in both relative and absolute frequency of occurrence, with a trimodal distribution of rainfall contribution versus feature height observed over the ocean. Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are found to be responsible for up to 90\% of rainfall in selected land regions. Tropicswide, MCSs are responsible for more than 50\% of rainfall in almost all regions with average annual rainfall exceeding 3 mm day−1. Characteristic variability in the contribution of rainfall by feature type is shown over land and ocean, which suggests new approaches for improved convective parameterizations. }

    abstract = { AbstractAn atmospheric classification for northwestern Australia is used to define periods of monsoon activity and investigate the interannual and intraseasonal variability of the Australian monsoon, as well as long-term precipitation trends at Darwin. The classification creates a time series of atmospheric states, which two correspond to the active monsoon and the monsoon break. Occurrence of these states is used to define onset, retreat, seasonal intensity, and individual active periods within seasons. The authors demonstrate the quality of their method by showing it consistently identifies extended periods of precipitation as part of the monsoon season and recreates well-known relationships between Australian monsoon onset, intensity, and ENSO. The authors also find that onset and seasonal intensity are significantly correlated with ENSO as early as July.Previous studies have investigated the role of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) during the monsoon by studying the frequency and duration of active periods, but these studies disagree on whether the MJO creates a characteristic period or duration. The authors use their metrics of monsoon activity and the Wheeler–Hendon MJO index to examine the timing of active periods relative to the phase of the MJO. It is shown that active periods preferentially begin during MJO phases 3 and 4, as the convective anomaly approaches Darwin, and end during phases 7 and 8, as the anomaly departs Darwin. Finally, the causes of the multidecadal positive precipitation trend at Darwin over the last few decades are investigated. It is found that an increase in the number of days classified as active, rather than changes in the daily rainfall rate during active monsoon periods, is responsible. }

Lightning occurrence detected by the World-Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) is composited in a framework centered on the MCSs. During MJO active periods, MCSs are more numerous and larger, as the convective features persist and attain greater horizontal scales. Anomalies of the lifted index, derived from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim) fields, indicate that MCS environments are more stable during MJO active periods.Over the Indian Ocean, Maritime Continent, and western Pacific, lightning density in an MCS maximizes during the time that the total number of systems begins to increase as the MJO is beginning to be more active, implying both more vigorous convection and less extensive stratiform rain areas at this transitional time of the MJO. The peak in MJO precipitation coincides with peak occurrence of interconnected MCSs with larger stratiform rain fraction, shown by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, while composites of lightning frequency show that during MJO active periods the zone of lightning is contracted around the centers of MCSs, and flashes are less frequent. }

    abstract = { Abstract The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite measurements from the precipitation radar and TRMM microwave imager have been combined to yield a comprehensive 3-yr database of precipitation features (PFs) throughout the global Tropics (±36° latitude). The PFs retrieved using this algorithm (which number nearly six million Tropicswide) have been sorted by size and intensity ranging from small shallow features greater than 75 km2 in area to large mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) according to their radar and ice scattering characteristics. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the diurnal cycle of the observed precipitation features' rainfall amount, precipitation feature frequency, rainfall intensity, convective–stratiform rainfall portioning, and remotely sensed convective intensity, sampled Tropicswide from space. The observations are sorted regionally to examine the stark differences in the diurnal cycle of rainfall and convective intensity over land and ocean areas. Over the oceans, the diurnal cycle of rainfall has small amplitude, with the maximum contribution to rainfall coming from MCSs in the early morning. This increased contribution is due to an increased number of MCSs in the nighttime hours, not increasing MCS areas or conditional rain rates, in agreement with previous works. Rainfall from sub-MCS features over the ocean has little appreciable diurnal cycle of rainfall or convective intensity. Land areas have a much larger rainfall cycle than over the ocean, with a marked minimum in the midmorning hours and a maximum in the afternoon, slowly decreasing through midnight. Non-MCS features have a significant peak in afternoon instantaneous conditional rain rates (the mean rain rate in raining pixels), and convective intensities, which differs from previous studies using rain rates derived from hourly rain gauges. This is attributed to enhancement by afternoon heating. MCSs over land have a convective intensity peak in the late afternoon, however all land regions have MCS rainfall peaks that occur in the late evening through midnight due to their longer life cycle. The diurnal cycle of overland MCS rainfall and convective intensity varies significantly among land regions, attributed to MCS sensitivity to the varying environmental conditions in which they occur. }

    abstract = { AbstractComparisons between direct measurements and modeled values of vertical air motions in precipitating systems are complicated by differences in temporal and spatial scales. On one hand, vertically profiling radars more directly measure the vertical air motion but do not adequately capture full storm dynamics. On the other hand, vertical air motions retrieved from two or more scanning Doppler radars capture the full storm dynamics but require model constraints that may not capture all updraft features because of inadequate sampling, resolution, numerical constraints, and the fact that the storm is evolving as it is scanned by the radars. To investigate the veracity of radar-based retrievals, which can be used to verify numerically modeled vertical air motions, this article presents several case studies from storm events around Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia, in which measurements from a dual-frequency radar profiler system and volumetric radar-based wind retrievals are compared. While a direct comparison was not possible because of instrumentation location, an indirect comparison shows promising results, with volume retrievals comparing well to those obtained from the profiling system. This prompted a statistical analysis of an extended period of an active monsoon period during the Tropical Warm Pool International Cloud Experiment (TWP-ICE). Results show less vigorous deep convective cores with maximum updraft velocities occurring at lower heights than some cloud-resolving modeling studies suggest. }

    abstract = { AbstractThe diurnal variation of convection and associated cloud and radiative properties remains a significant issue in global NWP and climate models. This study analyzes observed diurnal variability of convection in a coastal monsoonal environment examining the interaction of convective rain clouds, their associated cloud properties, and the impact on the surface radiation and corresponding boundary layer structure during periods where convection is suppressed or active on the large scale. The analysis uses data from the Tropical Warm Pool International Cloud Experiment (TWP-ICE) as well as routine measurements from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program. Both active monsoonal and large-scale suppressed (buildup and break) conditions are examined and demonstrate that the diurnal variation of rainfall is much larger during the break periods and the spatial distribution of rainfall is very different between the monsoon and break regimes. During the active monsoon the total net radiative input to the surface is decreased by more than 3 times the amount than during the break regime—this total radiative cloud forcing is found to be dominated by the shortwave (SW) cloud effects because of the much larger optical thicknesses and persistence of long-lasting anvils and cirrus cloud decks associated with the monsoon regime. These differences in monsoon versus break surface radiative energy contribute to low-level air temperature differences in the boundary layer over the land surfaces. }

Individual updrafts, defined as 3D objects with vertical velocity above 10 m s−1 are identified. Among the 20 000 updrafts formed during the most intense phase, only a dozen were more than 4 km tall. The two tallest updrafts accounted for more than 90\% of the total vertical mass flux through the tropical tropopause layer. Their locations were determined by low-level convergence lines first created by the sea breeze in the morning, then enhanced by cold pools due to cumulus congestus. They finally reinforced each other as they moved inland and intersected. The two tallest updrafts that overshot the tropopause were contrasted with those occurring 1 h earlier and later. They presented larger widths (up to 8 km), greater buoyancy (up to 0.1 m s−2), stronger vertical velocities (up to 50 m s−1), and larger hydrometeor contents (more than 10 g kg−1). They kept their core weakly diluted on their way to the stratosphere with an entrainment rate as low as 0.08 km−1. Both the low-level convergence lines intensified by cold pools and the reduced mixing in the troposphere were found to be the determinant for the transition from deep to very deep convection. }

    abstract = { Abstract Linear and nonlinear models are used to examine the development of island thunderstorms, in particular the Hector convective system that forms over the Tiwi Islands just north of Australia. The linear model is used to examine the flow response to an isolated, elliptical, heat source. It is found that the low-level convergence is maximized when the flow is weak and along the major axis of the heat source. A dry version of the nonlinear model verifies the trends predicted by the linear model except at very low flow speeds where the convergence is bounded in the nonlinear model but increases indefinitely in the linear model. Deep convection develops over the heat source when a moisture profile with positive convective available potential energy (CAPE) is added to the nonlinear model. The sensitivity of the convective strength (defined by the accumulated rainfall and total condensate) to wind speed and direction, surface fluxes, and low-level moisture is then examined. It is shown that the strength increases as the wind speed decreases and as the wind direction turns toward the major axis of the island, in agreement with the prediction of increased low-level convergence from the linear and nonlinear dry models. Sensitivity experiments indicate that the convective strength increases as both the heat and moisture fluxes increase. The strength is more sensitive to the heat flux since this drives the large-scale convergence and sea breezes that generate convection. As the low-level moisture in the upstream sounding increases, the accumulated rainfall over the islands increases monotonically; however, the total condensate reaches a maximum at a CAPE of around 1500 J kg−1 and then decreases thereafter. It is shown that the low-level moisture is an important predictor of the form of convective development. Finally, simulations with a single coastline are performed to show that one of the reasons the Hector convective system is so strong is that it develops over an island where the land–sea circulation from all coastlines can contribute. }

    abstract = { Abstract A cluster analysis is applied to the mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) that developed in northern Australia and the surrounding oceans during six wet seasons (September–April) from 1995/96 to 2000/01. During this period, 13 585 MCSs were identified and tracked using an infrared channel (IR1) on the Japanese Meteorological Agency Geostationary Meteorological Satellite 5 (GMS5). Based on the lifetimes of the MCSs, the area covered by cloud, the expansion rate of the cloud, the minimum cloud-top temperature, and their zonal direction of propagation, the MCSs are grouped objectively into four classes. One of the strengths of the analysis is that it objectively condenses a large dataset into a small number of classes, each with its own physical characteristics. MCSs in class 1 (short) are relatively short lived, with 95\% having lifetimes less than 5 h, and they are found most frequently over the oceans during the early and late parts of the wet season. MCSs in classes 2 and 3 [long and intermediate west (Int-West)] are longer lived and propagate to the west, developing over continental northwest Australia in deep easterly flow during breaks in the monsoon. These two classes are distinguished principally by their lifetime, with 95\% of MCSs in the long class having lifetimes exceeding 4 h. Class 4 (Int-East) comprises MCSs that form over the subtropical latitudes of eastern Australia and in the deep westerly flow over northern parts of the continent during the monsoon and active phases of the MJO. }

    abstract = { Abstract The ability of C-band polarimetric radar to account for strong attenuation/differential attenuation is demonstrated in two cases of heavy rain that occurred in the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area on 5 August 2008 and in central Oklahoma on 10 March 2009. The performance of the polarimetric attenuation correction scheme that separates relative contributions of “hot spots” (i.e., strong convective cells) and the rest of the storm to the path-integrated total and differential attenuation has been explored. It is shown that reliable attenuation correction is possible if the radar signal is attenuated by as much as 40 dB. Examination of the experimentally derived statistics of the ratios of specific attenuation Ah and differential attenuation ADP to specific differential phase KDP in hot spots is included in this study. It is shown that these ratios at C band are highly variable within the hot spots. Validation of the attenuation correction algorithm at C band has been performed through cross-checking with S-band radar measurements that were much less affected by attenuation. In the case of the Oklahoma storm, a comparison was made between the data collected by closely located C-band and S-band polarimetric radars. }

    abstract = { Abstract A season of operational cell and track data from Darwin, Australia, has been analyzed to explore the statistical characteristics of the convective cell heights. The statistics for the monsoon and break regimes are significantly different with the break season cells being higher for a given reflectivity threshold. The monsoon cells produce more rain, but there are fewer intense cells and there is a much larger contribution from stratiform rain. The monsoon cells are also slightly larger, but shorter lived than the breaks. The shorter lifetime may reflect a more rapid transition to a longer-lived stratiform character. The monsoon regime is shown to be associated with large-scale ascent and higher humidity that may lead to more frequent, but weaker cells. Within regimes, the subset of intense cells generally reach near the tropopause or overshoot. However, there is little evidence in the data for a multimodal distribution of cell heights, except perhaps for the intense monsoon cases. Instead, the picture is a continuous distribution of cell heights with the peak of the distribution shifting to higher values as the distributions are conditioned on higher reflectivity. }

    abstract = { Abstract Observations and analyses of water vapor and clouds in the Tropics over the past decade show that the boundary between regions of high and low free–tropospheric relative humidity is sharp, and that upper–level cirrus and high free–tropospheric relative humidity tend to coincide. Most current studies of atmospheric climate feedbacks have focused on such quantities as clear sky humidity, average humidity, or differences between regions of high and low humidity, but the data suggest that another possible feedback might consist of changes in the relative areas of high and low humidity and cloudiness. Motivated by the observed relation between cloudiness (above the trade wind boundary layer) and high humidity, cloud data for the eastern part of the western Pacific from the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite–5 (which provides high spatial and temporal resolution) have been analyzed, and it has been found that the area of cirrus cloud coverage normalized by a measure of the area of cumulus coverage decreases about 22\% per degree Celsius increase in the surface temperature of the cloudy region. A number of possible interpretations of this result are examined and a plausible one is found to be that cirrus detrainment from cumulus convection diminishes with increasing temperature. The implications of such an effect for climate are examined using a simple two–dimensional radiative–convective model. The calculations show that such a change in the Tropics could lead to a negative feedback in the global climate, with a feedback factor of about –1.1, which if correct, would more than cancel all the positive feedbacks in the more sensitive current climate models. Even if regions of high humidity were not coupled to cloudiness, the feedback factor due to the clouds alone would still amount to about –0.45, which would cancel model water vapor feedback in almost all models. This new mechanism would, in effect, constitute an adaptive infrared iris that opens and closes in order to control the Outgoing Longwave Radiation in response to changes in surface temperature in a manner similar to the way in which an eye's iris opens and closes in response to changing light levels. Not surprisingly, for upper–level clouds, their infrared effect dominates their shortwave effect. Preliminary attempts to replicate observations with GCMs suggest that models lack such a negative cloud/moist areal feedback. }

    abstract = { Abstract The variability of the Australian summer monsoon is reexamined using data covering 35 monsoon seasons. A new, easily applied objective definition of active and break phases of the monsoon, based solely on the zonal wind at Darwin, is proposed. Attempts to define “wet westerly” onsets are shown to be misleading, since no clear relationship is found between westerly winds and rainfall, on the timescales associated with the transition between active and break phases. The resulting dates of monsoon onset at Darwin differ from those reported in some recent studies, resulting in significantly different relationships with the Southern Oscillation. In particular, the date of monsoon onset is shown to be significantly related to, and hence predicted from, prior values of the Southern Oscillation index. Also in contrast to a number of recent studies that have highlighted the so-called 40–50-day oscillation in the Australian summer monsoon, no dominant timescales are found in the length of the active periods or in the recurrence time between active phases. }

Five objectively derived regimes of the wet season are obtained and are found to differ significantly in their synoptic environment, cloud patterns, and rainfall distributions. One regime is primarily associated with the trade wind regime. Two regimes are associated with the lead up to and break periods of the monsoon at Darwin. A fourth regime is clearly identified with the active monsoon at Darwin and is offered as a definition of monsoon onset. This regime captures the active monsoon environment associated with significant widespread rainfall. The fifth regime is a mixed regime, with some days associated with the inactive monsoon, a period of westerly zonal winds at Darwin associated with relatively suppressed convection compared with the active monsoon. Other days for this regime are break period conditions with a low-level westerly flow below 900 hPa. }

    abstract = { Abstract A seasonally independent index for monitoring the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) is described. It is based on a pair of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of the combined fields of near-equatorially averaged 850-hPa zonal wind, 200-hPa zonal wind, and satellite-observed outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data. Projection of the daily observed data onto the multiple-variable EOFs, with the annual cycle and components of interannual variability removed, yields principal component (PC) time series that vary mostly on the intraseasonal time scale of the MJO only. This projection thus serves as an effective filter for the MJO without the need for conventional time filtering, making the PC time series an effective index for real-time use. The pair of PC time series that form the index are called the Real-time Multivariate MJO series 1 (RMM1) and 2 (RMM2). The properties of the RMM series and the spatial patterns of atmospheric variability they capture are explored. Despite the fact that RMM1 and RMM2 describe evolution of the MJO along the equator that is independent of season, the coherent off-equatorial behavior exhibits strong seasonality. In particular, the northward, propagating behavior in the Indian monsoon and the southward extreme of convection into the Australian monsoon are captured by monitoring the seasonally independent eastward propagation in the equatorial belt. The previously described interannual modulation of the global variance of the MJO is also well captured. Applications of the RMM series are investigated. One application is through their relationship with the onset dates of the monsoons in Australia and India; while the onsets can occur at any time during the convectively enhanced half of the MJO cycle, they rarely occur during the suppressed half. Another application is the modulation of the probability of extreme weekly rainfall; in the “Top End” region around Darwin, Australia, the swings in probability represent more than a tripling in the likelihood of an upper-quintile weekly rainfall event from the dry to wet MJO phase. }

    abstract = { Abstract Nearly ten years of daily rawinsonde data for Canton Island (3S, 172W) have been subjected to spectrum and cross-spectrum analysis. In the course of this analysis a very pronounced maximum was noted in the co-spectrum of the 850- and 150-mb zonal wind components in the frequency range 0.0245–0.0190 day−1 (41–53 days period). Application of a posteriori sampling theory resulted in a significance level of ∼6\% (0.1\% prior confidence level). This type of significance test is appropriate because no prior evidence or reason existed for expecting such a spectral feature. Subsequent analysis revealed the following structure of the oscillation. Peaks in the variance spectra of the zonal wind are strong in the low troposphere, are weak or non-existent in the 700–400 mb layer, and are strong again in the upper troposphere. No evidence of this feature could be found above 80 mb, or in any of the spectra of the meridional component. The spectrum of station pressure possesses a peak in this frequency range and the oscillation is in phase with the low tropospheric zonal wind oscillation, and out of phase with that in the upper troposphere. The tropospheric temperatures exhibit a similar peak and are highly coherent with the station pressure oscillation; positive station pressure anomalies are associated with negative temperature anomalies throughout the troposphere. Thus, the lower-middle troposphere appears to be a nodal surface with u and P oscillating in phase but 180° out of phase above and below this surface. Evidence for this phenomenon was found in shorter records at Kwajalein (9N, 168E) but not at Singapore (1N, 104E) or Balboa, Canal Zone (9N, 79w). We speculate that the oscillation is a large circulation cell oriented in zonal planes and centered in the mid-Pacific. }

    abstract = { Abstract It has long been known that trade wind cumulus and deep cumulonimbus represent primary components of the broad spectrum of cumulus clouds in the Tropics, which has led to the concept of a bimodal distribution of tropical clouds. However, recent analyses of shipboard radar data from Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) provide evidence of abundant populations of a third cloud type, cumulus congestus. Congestus clouds constitute over half the precipitating convective clouds in COARE and contribute over one-quarter of the total convective rainfall. Global Atmospheric Research Program Atlantic Tropical Experiment studies reveal a similar midlevel peak in the distribution of radar-echo tops. These findings lead to the conclusion that shallow cumulus, congestus, and cumulonimbus are all prominent tropical cumulus cloud types. They are associated with trimodal distributions of divergence, cloud detrainment, and fractional cloudiness in the Tropics. The peaks in the distributions of radar-echo tops for these three cloud types are in close proximity to prominent stable layers that exist over the Pacific warm pool and the tropical eastern Atlantic: near 2 km (the trade stable layer), ∼5 km (near 0°C), and ∼15–16 km (the tropopause). These stable layers are inferred to inhibit cloud growth and promote cloud detrainment. The 0°C stable layer can produce detrainment from cumulonimbi (attendant shelf clouds) and help retard the growth of precipitation-laden and strongly entraining congestus clouds. Moreover, restriction of growth of congestus clouds to just above the 0°C level limits further enhancement of cloud buoyancy through glaciation. The three cloud types are found to vary significantly during COARE on the timescale of the 30–60-day intraseasonal oscillation. The specific roles of clouds of the congestus variety in the general circulation are not yet clear, but some (the shallower ones) contribute to moistening and preconditioning the atmosphere for deep convection; others (the deeper ones) contribute an important fraction of the total tropical rainfall, and both likely produce many midlevel clouds, thereby modulating the radiative heating of the tropical atmosphere. }

The eight phases of the Madden–Julian oscillation as defined by Wheeler and Hendon (Mon Weather Rev 132(8):1917–1932, 2004) were used as indicators of different large-scale environments. The analysis found that the large-scale forcing starts to build up from phase 4 by the reversal of low- to mid-level easterly winds to moist westerly winds, reaching a maximum in phase 5 and weakening through phases 6–7. During phases 4–6, most of the study domain experiences widespread rainfall, but with distinct spatial and temporal structures. In addition, during these phases, coastal areas near Darwin receive more rainfall in the early morning (0200–0400 LT) due to the spreading or expansion of rainfall from the Beagle Gulf, explaining the occurrence of a secondary diurnal rainfall peak over Darwin. In contrast, local-scale mechanisms (sea breezes) reinvigorate from phase 8, further strengthening through phases 1–3, when low-level easterly winds become established over Darwin producing rainfall predominately over land and island locations during the afternoon. During these phases, below average rainfall is observed over most of the radar domain, except over the Tiwi Islands in phase 2.}

    abstract = { AbstractTwo seasons of Darwin, Australia, C-band polarimetric (CPOL) research radar, radiosoundings, and lightning data are examined to study the relative influence of the large-scale atmospheric regimes and the underlying surface types on tropical convective cloud properties and their diurnal evolution. The authors find that in the “deep westerly” regime, which corresponds to the monsoon period, the convective cloud occurrence rate is highest, consistent with its highest relative humidity. However, these convective clouds have relatively low cloud-top heights, smaller-than-average cell volumes, and are electrically least active. In this regime, the cloud cell volume does not vary significantly across different underlying surfaces and afternoon convective activity is suppressed. Thus, the picture emerging is that the convective cloud activity in the deep westerly regime is primarily regulated by the large-scale conditions. The remaining regimes (“easterly,” “shallow westerly,” and “moist easterly”) also demonstrate strong dependence on the large-scale forcing and a secondary dependence on the underlying surface type. The easterly regime has a small convective cloud occurrence rate and low cloud heights but higher lightning counts per convective cloud. The other two regimes have moderate convective cloud occurrence rates and larger cloud sizes. The easterly, shallow westerly, and moist easterly regimes exhibit a strong, clearly defined semidiurnal convective cloud occurrence pattern, with peaks in the early morning and afternoon periods. The cell onset times in these three regimes depend on the combination of local time and the underlying surface. }

    abstract = { Abstract This paper summarizes the development of a convergent weighted-averaging interpolation scheme which can be used to obtain any desired amount of detail in the analysis of a set of randomly spaced data. The scheme is based on the supposition that the two-dimensional distribution of an atmospheric variable can be represented by the summation of an infinite number of independent waves, i.e., a Fourier integral representation. The practical limitations of the scheme are that the data distribution be reasonably uniform and that the data be accurate. However, the effect of inaccuracies can be controlled by stopping the convergence scheme before the data errors are greatly amplified. The scheme has been tested in the analysis of 500-mb height data over the United States producing a result with details comparable to those obtainable by careful manual analysis. A test analysis of sea level pressure based on the data obtained at only the upper air network stations produced results with essentially the same features as the analysis produced at the National Meteorological Center. Further tests based on a regional sampling of stations reporting airways data demonstrate the applicability of the scheme to mesoscale wavelengths. }

    abstract = { Abstract Three algorithms extract information on precipitation type, structure, and amount from operational radar and rain gauge data. Tests on one month of data from one site show that the algorithms perform accurately and provide products that characterize the essential features of the precipitation climatology. Input to the algorithms are the operationally executed volume scans of a radar and the data from a surrounding rain gauge network. The algorithms separate the radar echoes into convective and stratiform regions, statistically summarize the vertical structure of the radar echoes, and determine precipitation rates and amounts on high spatial resolution. The convective and stratiform regions are separated on the basis of the intensity and sharpness of the peaks of echo intensity. The peaks indicate the centers of the convective region. Precipitation not identified as convective is stratiform. This method avoids the problem of underestimating the stratiform precipitation. The separation criteria are applied in exactly the same way throughout the observational domain and the product generated by the algorithm can be compared directly to model output. An independent test of the algorithm on data for which high-resolution dual-Doppler observations are available shows that the convective stratiform separation algorithm is consistent with the physical definitions of convective and stratiform precipitation. The vertical structure algorithm presents the frequency distribution of radar reflectivity as a function of height and thus summarizes in a single plot the vertical structure of all the radar echoes observed during a month (or any other time period). Separate plots reveal the essential differences in structure between the convective and stratiform echoes. Tests yield similar results (within less than 10\%) for monthly rain statistics regardless of the technique used for estimating the precipitation, as long as the radar reflectivity values are adjusted to agree with monthly rain gauge data. It makes little difference whether the adjustment is by monthly mean rates or percentiles. Further tests show that 1-h sampling is sufficient to obtain an accurate estimate of monthly rain statistics. }

    abstract = { Abstract Lookup tables for estimating the cloud-top height and visible optical thickness of upper-tropospheric clouds by the infrared brightness temperature TB at 10.8 μm (T11) and its difference from TB at 12 μm (ΔT11–12) measured by a geostationary satellite are presented. These lookup tables were constructed by regressing the cloud radar measurements by the CloudSat satellite over the infrared measurements by the Japanese geostationary multifunctional transport satellite MTSAT-1R. Standard deviations of measurements around the estimates were also displayed as an indicator of the ambiguity in the estimates. For the upper-tropospheric clouds with T11 < 240 K, the standard deviations of the height estimations were less than 1 km. The dependences of the estimates of cloud-top height at each point in T11−ΔT11–12 space on latitude, season, satellite zenith angle, day–night, and land–sea differences were examined. It was shown that these dependences were considered uniform in the tropics except for the region with large satellite zenith angle. The presented lookup tables can provide hourly estimates of cloud-top height and optical thickness at a specified location and are fairly useful in comparing them with ground-based observations such as vertical profiles of humidity and/or wind. }

    abstract = { Abstract Continuous vertical velocity measurements using a 50-MHz wind profiler located at Darwin in northern Australia during periods of active convection have been analyzed. This dataset is dominated by continental-type convection. Numerous examples of shallow, deep, and decaying convection were seen and it is shown that only the deep systems have substantial tilts to the draft structure. The most intense updrafts occur above the freezing level, but shallow convection also produces large-amplitude vertical motions. The strength of these updrafts in this dataset is very similar to other tropical, oceanic data. That observation is consistent with the idea that the magnitude of the updrafts is much less in the Tropics than for intense midlatitude convection because the convective available potential energy is distributed over a much deeper layer in the Tropics, although more intense updrafts may be present at other tropical locations, such as the Tiwi Islands north of Darwin. The size of the cores, however, is significantly greater here than with oceanic data and is similar to midlatitude results, thus supporting the suggestion that boundary layer depth is important in determining the horizontal scale. There is a net detrainment in the upward cores above the freezing level occurring at all space scales. The mass flux in intense updrafts is almost constant with height below the freezing level but is almost cancelled by downdrafts and the immediate surrounding environment. Two populations of downdrafts are seen, one a dynamical response associated with intense updrafts at all heights and a second driven by precipitation processes below the freezing level. The core size, intensity, and mass flux are all approximately lognormally distributed. It is shown that a wide range of velocity and size scales contribute to the upward mass flux. }
